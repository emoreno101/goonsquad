        <h2>The Story of Urga</h2>
        <p>Deep within the rolling green fields of Elwynn Forest, where the rivers ran clear and the trees whispered secrets of ancient days, a gnome named Urga was born. He was no noble of Stormwind, no battle-hardened warrior from the front lines—just a small little mage, raised among golden wheat and sturdy fences, where life was simple, and the world was small as he was. </p>

        <p>Urga had always known he was different. As he trained with the village mages, casting fireball and sparring with the other little gnomes, he did not feel his heart race for the blushing innkeeper’s daughter or the merchant’s fair-haired niece. Instead, it was the apprentice rogue, with his calloused hands and warm smile, who caught his eye. It was Turbo, the Leader of the Pack druids' son, Choney, who set his pulse quickening, his dagger always at his side, his presence as steady as the Northshire Abbey’s bell tolls.</p>

        <p>But in the villages of Azeroth, love was spoken of in legends and hearth-tales—brave knights rescuing noble maidens, kings ruling beside their queens. There were no stories of a boy who longed for the embrace of another.</p>

        <p>And so, Urga kept his secret.</p>

        <p>Yet Azeroth is a land of adventure, where destiny calls even the quietest souls. One evening, as the crimson sun dipped beneath the Westfall horizon, Urga and Choney sat by the river that wound its way past Goldshire. Fireflies danced in the air, and the croaking of murlocks filled the silence between them.</p>

        <p>“Choney,” Urga murmured, staring at the water’s shimmering surface, “have you ever felt… different?”</p>

        <p>Choney turned to him, his keen eyes dark as the forests of Teldrassil. There was a pause, the kind of silence warriors share before unsheathing their blades—a moment of unspoken understanding.</p>

        <p>“Yes,” Choney admitted. “I have.”</p>

        <p>Urga swallowed hard, his gnome fingers tightening around the cloth strap of his belt. He had slain kobolds in the mine, trained in the ways of fire and ice, but no battle had ever made his heart pound as fiercely as this one.</p>

        <p>“I think I love the way you watch the stars,” Urga whispered. “I think I love the way you move, like a feral on the hunt, yet never too proud to let a lost soul walk beside you.”</p>

        <p>A slow smile tugged at Choney’s lips. He reached out, his hand brushing Urga’s, as gentle as the wind rustling through the branches of Darkshore’s ancient trees.</p>

        <p>The kingdom of Stormwind would murmur in time. Some would frown, their minds chained to old ways, their hearts bound by tradition as tight as the plate armor of a paladin. But others—those who had walked Azeroth’s roads and seen the world beyond its walls—would understand.</p>

        <p>Urga had been named for the light in the storm. And now, beneath the same sky that watched over heroes and legends, he was ready to shine.</p>
